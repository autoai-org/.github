## Hi there!

Hi there! At AutoAI, we're building gears for the future of machine learning - A more automatic, more accessible and more flexible machine learning.

### What we do

* [Project AID](https://github.com/autoai-org/AID): With Project AID, we are trying to build a platform that everyone can upload, share and reuse machine learning models. It is like the App Store, the NPM and the Python Package Index, but for machine learning. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ulW_8phgs), [Documents](https://aid.autoai.org/), [Model Hub](https://hub.autoai.dev/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aid_aiops).
* [TinyML](https://github.com/autoai-org/Tinyml): TinyML is a simple, lightweight machine learning framework implemented in pure Python, for educational purpose. [Documents](https://github.com/autoai-org/Tinyml).
* [VectorDB](https://github.com/ComposeDB/vectorDB): A simple vector database built on top of [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) and [Redis](https://redis.com/).
* [MLSys Wiki](https://mlsys.autoai.dev/): A wikipedia that contains lots of stuff about machine learning and systems.

Please stay tuned for more news and updates :)
