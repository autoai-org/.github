## Hi there!

Hi there! At AutoAI, we're building gears for the future of machine learning - A more automatic, more accessible and more flexible machine learning. Initially we were funded by the innovator fellowship from [ETH Library Lab](https://github.com/eth-library-lab) for the project [AID](https://github.com/autoai-org/AID), and later on continued as a free community for anyone to work together on demoncratizing machine learning.

### What we do

#### Systems for MLOps

* [Project AID](https://github.com/autoai-org/AID): With Project AID, we are trying to build a platform that everyone can upload, share and reuse machine learning models. It is like the App Store, the NPM, and the Python Package Index, but for machine learning models. [Documents](https://aid.autoai.org/) and [Model Hub](https://hub.autoai.dev/).
* [ShiFTML](https://github.com/autoai-org/shiftml): ShiftML is an efficient and flexible search engine for transfer learning. [Documents](https://shiftml.autoai.org).
* [TinyNet](https://github.com/autoai-org/Tinyml): TinyML is a simple, lightweight machine learning framework implemented in pure Python, for educational purpose. [Documents](https://github.com/autoai-org/Tinyml).

#### Data-Centric AI Development

* [Data Cleaning Challenge @ DataPerf](https://www.dataperf.org/training-set-cleaning-vision): With the data cleaning challenge, we hope to direct human attention (cleaning efforts) toward data examples that matter more to the improvement of ML models.

#### ML Systems at Larger-Scale

* [GMService](https://github.com/autoai-org/gmservice): A modular framework for serving generative models.
* [FFMZip](https://github.com/autoai-org/ffmzip): FFMZip is a system for efficiently serving finetuned foundation models.
* [FMEngine](https://github.com/autoai-org/fmengine): Experimental Training/Serving framework for foundation models.

Please stay tuned for more news and updates :)
